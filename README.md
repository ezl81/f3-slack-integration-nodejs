<h1>NodeJS Backblast to Slack Integration</h1>
<p>SlackBlast JS is a form based way to fill out backblasts.  It integrates with PaxMiner to allow for pulling in AOâ€™s that are used and formats the backblast in Slack to make it compatible with PaxMiner.  The user just has to type /backblast into a message window in Slack and the form pops up to allow them to get started.</p>
